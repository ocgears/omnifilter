# Overview
The Omnifilter app is designed to enable the work of filtering images provided by a user on a multitude of server environments. As node.js is fantastic for making web apps, OpenCL is a way to harness the fantastic power of GPUs and multi-core CPUs. Initial work has been on the Mac OSX platform due to the standard installation of OpenCL. Enabling additional platforms is in the works.

Our application is still under development, thank you for your patience.
