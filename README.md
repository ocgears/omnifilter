# Overview
The Omnifilter app is designed to enable the work of filtering images provided by a user on a multitude of server environments. As node.js is fantastic for making web apps, OpenCL is a way to harness the fantastic power of GPUs and multi-core CPUs. Initial work has been on the Mac OSX platform due to the standard installation of OpenCL. Enabling additional platforms is in the works.

Our application is still under development, thank you for your patience.

# Usage
Installing on NPM
```
npm install omnifilter
```

To run locally use
```
npm start
```
which will start mongo, and both backend and client servers. (Make sure to create a 'db' directory in the root of the project, or update the command to your preferred path.)
